```
`./bin/propeller` to run the service
```
./bin/propeller
```

## Testing

Build the sample client
```
make build-sample-client
```

`connect` the client
```
bin/propeller-client -action=connect -clientID=clientID
```

`send-event` with the client
```shell
bin/propeller-client -action=send-event -clientID=clientID
```
`connect` the client with an additional topic
```bash
 bin/propeller-client -action=connect -clientID=client -topic=test
